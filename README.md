## Prerequisites

You will need:

* An AWS IAM user account included in the
  `arn:aws:iam::000000000000:role/aws-lambda-basic-execution-role` role.
  * The account must have MFA enabled
* You will need [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault)

## Setup

Clone it. Yarn it.

```bash
yarn
```

Then, make sure to change the service name in `serverless.yml`.

## IAM Credentials, Roles, and Permissions

Yah. You need those.

@TODO

Any commands which interact with AWS APIs assume your IAM credentials are stored
in [AWS Vault](https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault), and that the profile is
called `allthings`â€”ideally with MFA enabled.

@TODO: expand on this.

You will need to add the following to your `~/.aws/config` file. Create it, if
it does not exist.

```ini
[profile allthings]
region = eu-west-1
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::000000000000:mfa/your.username
```

## Development

### Invoke Locally:

```bash
yarn invoke:local myFunctionName --path event-mocks/scheduled-event.json
```

or

```bash
yarn invoke:local myFunctionName --data '{"some": "eventData"}'
```

### Developing with tests

```bash
yarn watch:test
```

Then, develop and run code via tests. See
[src/handler.js](blob/master/src/handler.js) and
[src/handler.test.js](blob/master/src/handler.test.js) for examples.

You can also run the full test suite with coverage report:

```bash
yarn test
```

### With Localhost HTTP

```bash
yarn dev:offline
```

Uses [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)

### Locally Invoke in Docker

```bash
yarn test:docker handler.hello '{"some": "eventData"}'
```

Uses [docker-lambda](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda). Can also be used
in tests:

```js
import dockerLambda from 'docker-lambda'

const lambdaCallbackResult = dockerLambda({
  event: { some: 'event' },
  taskDir: __dirname,
  dockerImage: 'lambci/lambda:nodejs6.10',
})
```

### Run as a service within Allthings Docker dev-env

lol. todo.

```bash
allthings-up
```

Then, access on `https://lambda.dev.allthings.me/dev/myFunctionName`

Just kidding. @TODO. lol. Doesn't work, yet. Blocked.

## Deployment

Deploy entire service with all functions:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

Deploy specific function:

```bash
yarn deploy -f myFunctionName
```

Where `myFunctionName` is defined in the `functions` section of
`serverless.yml`.

## Invocation

To manually invoke the deployed function from your terminal:

```bash
yarn invoke myFunctionName --path event-mocks/scheduled-event.json
```

or

```bash
yarn invoke myFunctionName --data '{"some": "eventData"}'
```

## Logs

See logs for a function from CloudWatch in your terminal:

```bash
yarn logs myFunctionName
```

## Metrics

See metrics for a function in your terminal:

```bash
yarn metrics myFunctionName
```

## How-to

### ES2017

Yep. Check out the Babel [recipe](./tree/master/babel).
