some reasons why i like gql and would pick it over REST/CRUD:
- avoid overfetching
- tools like apollo-client have built in caching solutions
- support for query subscriptionsâ€”no need to come up with or use some additional websocket data-exchange format
- very enjoyable to develop
- easy to set up in lambda, koa, express
- automatic documentation via the introspection (especially if you provide field description in schema)
  - yea yea yea but but swagger... yea.. it's not the same.
- very enjoyable to develop against, e.g. in react, or even standalone
- tools exist to easily query gql apis outside of a react app, server side
- the introspection lets you generate an SDK. perfect for a developer platform.
- the introspection lets you generate type definitions for use in code (e.g. TypeScript, or Golang)
- if you enjoy writing SQL queries, GQL will also be enjoyable
- quick api iteration, support for @deprecated fields
- easy code separation/organisation
- easily express and query complex data structures
- with the introspection, it's possible to visualise a graphql api
- if you're skeptical, please, give it 5 minutes. ( https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes )
